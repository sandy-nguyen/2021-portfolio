          I spent my 2020 summer at Goinvo working on Gio, an app that aims to help ASD caregivers through digital
          coordination and behavior tracking. <br /><br />Goinvo had previously ideated on this project back in 2018,
          but never got to finishing it. Jinghan (the other intern) and I decided to pick up from their previous work
          because it was a complex problem that we were passionate about. The agency is currently in the process of
          gathering funding for this concept.

          In the field of Autism research and study, parents’ data input is considered somewhat not reliable or
          trustworthy in the clinician’s perspective. Due to its inconsistency, there is a lack of training and enormous
          stress placed on the parents in the caregiving journey. However, parental involvement is extremely important
          for the progression of skills from ABA therapy sessions to more natural settings, and for the success of the
          child receiving ABA. Several studies have found that children are more successful when parents are
          consistently involved in the treatment (Ozonoff &amp; Cathcart, 1998).<br /><br />This collective effort
          requires the care team to assess the child, come up with a treatment plan, collect data, use data as guidance
          for therapy, and intervention to reassess. Therefore, we should design a consistent, efficient, and
          understandable way to help parents collect their ASD child’s data, so that they can contribute insights to
          their child’s treatment, understand their child better, and become a better advocate for their child’s autism.

        <p class="text-71 poppins-normal-lynch-14px-2">
          Goinvo’s previous work was extremely well researched and served as a great foundation for our app. However, it
          was last worked on in 2018, and so the designs were extremely outdated. Before I could pick up from where they
          had left off, I wanted to first understand Autism and the complexity of the disorder from different
          spectrums.<br /><br />I read and highlighted the secondary research done in the studio, reviewed academic
          papers, watched ABA training videos, parent interview videos, and even documentaries on how people with autism
          live their daily lives and interact with their providers/caregivers. We looked at competitor apps (for ex.
          Birdbox), but there was nothing on the current market that alligned with our problem scope.<br /><br />We also
          read The New York Times Understanding Autism magazine religiously. This special issue covers topics ranging
          from child and family, autism and science, aiding the autistic, and autism in our culture. Articles and
          testimonials from various stakeholders helped us to understand and explore the problem scope.
          <br /><br />Together, these secondary research sources helped us build a solid foundation for our design and
          gave us the essential background knowledge that helped us make interview protocols for our primary research.

          Jessica&#39;s 6 year old son Lucas was recently diagnosed with high functioning ASD. Although it was hard for
          the family to accept Lucas&#39;s diagnosis, the family have decided to get Lucas to do therapy as soon as
          possible so Lucas can gain more social skills. Lucas&#39;s doctor had suggested ABA therapy for the family to
          try out. Jessica took their son to a local ABA therapy center. After the waiting period, the BCBA Erin was
          able to assess Lucas on his behavior and performance.

          We chose orange because it represented encouragement, enthusiasm, and determination. Since purple is a bit of
          a cooler tone, we decided to make this our base color because it balanced out the bright orange and
          complimented the scheme well. We wanted to be wary of color contrast ratios because of WCAG accesibility
          standards and were mindful of this when choosing our surfaces, text, and line colors. As for our typography,
          we chose the sans serif font Gilroy since it was a modern font with a geometric touch. The geometric font
          paired nicely with our flat design, and had flexible font weights.
        </p>
        <p class="text-100 poppins-normal-lynch-14px">
          Furthermore, I made a parent task flow to show how Jessica would use this app in her scenario and to display
          the detailed interactions that would help us ideate wireframes. After reviewing our user task flow for the
          document management system feature, we decided to eliminate it. We wanted to make sure we would design the
          feature when we had more research on privacy. Our initial idea was to use a google drive integration, but
          their system’s privacy is not ideal because once a file is deleted there are still traces of it in the system.
          (Google is currently working on fixing this!)

        <p class="text-101 poppins-normal-lynch-14px">
          Before moving to the final design, we scheduled a meeting with our parent participants to review our
          wireframes. They gave us a lot of good feedback and raised some concerns about privacy regarding our fourth
          module of the concept map—the connect with others/sharing profile feature. We took her insights, and iterated
          on our wireframes. For the final design, we focused on designing the screens for the key tasks that we
          conjured up in our storyboards, and using Jessica’s scenario, we selected the several screens below to show
          the key features of each task.
        </p>
        <p class="text-102 poppins-normal-lynch-14px">
          This feature allows parents to create a routine for their child and act upon skill deficits/problematic
          behaviors by tracking behavior goals suggested by therapists at home. This tracked data overtime can create
          insights and explanations for certain behaviors. In Jessica’s case, she would use this to track whether or not
          Lucas has been succeeding in his morning routine by making sure he completes his nested mini tasks and
          checking if there are any improvements in behavior.

          The journal entry feature allows parents to record major incidents/outbursts, and their potential cause

          example, this might help Jessica record any actions that help Lucas stop his outburts effectively. (Calling
          Lucas’ favorite teacher helps him calm down when he is self harming himself.)

          Initially, the child’s profile was supposed to have the fourth module that allowed users to connect with other
          patients with similar profiles. However, we felt that we needed to work on a better flow for privacy and chose
          to hold off on this feature until we could better visualize a solution for this regarding HIPAA. The child’s
          profile enables the parent to add users to the caregiving team, and access the insight center shown above.

          The resource center is a education hub that gives parents and patients the ability to learn from curated

          types of resources provided. First, there are articles and short posts that parents can read for quick
          information. Secondly, there are interactive videos that users can watch. Lastly, we created an interactive

          All in all, in the future we plan to build out a communication feature that allows providers and caretakers to
          exchange health information regarding the child (with HIPAA compliance of course)! A future documentation
          management system would be something to consider as well. We might also explore an ASD child profile matching
          feature to create a networking aspect and build communities that will empower each other. Furthermore, we want
          to come up with guidelines to potentially use this model to adapt for other special needs. One constraint Gio
          has is that this app is still created with a specific scenario in mind (Jessica’s). I want to interview more
          parents to explore the unmet needs of children on the spectrum, and potentially co-design with them. The
          clinician’s app view needs to be ideated too. We plan to interview ASD children, since at some point, the data
          that is being collected will become theirs as they become adults. One team member is working on this for her
          thesis to continue the project. More to come!

          I spent my 2020 summer at Goinvo working on Gio, an app that aims to help ASD caregivers through digital
          coordination and behavior tracking. <br /><br />Goinvo had previously ideated on this project back in 2018,
          but never got to finishing it. Jinghan (the other intern) and I decided to pick up from their previous work
          because it was a complex problem that we were passionate about. The agency is currently in the process of
          gathering funding for this concept.

          In the field of Autism research and study, parents’ data input is considered somewhat not reliable or
          trustworthy in the clinician’s perspective. Due to its inconsistency, there is a lack of training and enormous
          stress placed on the parents in the caregiving journey. However, parental involvement is extremely important
          for the progression of skills from ABA therapy sessions to more natural settings, and for the success of the
          child receiving ABA. Several studies have found that children are more successful when parents are
          consistently involved in the treatment (Ozonoff &amp; Cathcart, 1998).<br /><br />This collective effort
          requires the care team to assess the child, come up with a treatment plan, collect data, use data as guidance
          for therapy, and intervention to reassess. Therefore, we should design a consistent, efficient, and
          understandable way to help parents collect their ASD child’s data, so that they can contribute insights to
          their child’s treatment, understand their child better, and become a better advocate for their child’s autism.

          Goinvo’s previous work was extremely well researched and served as a great foundation for our app. However, it
          was last worked on in 2018, and so the designs were extremely outdated. Before I could pick up from where they
          had left off, I wanted to first understand Autism and the complexity of the disorder from different
          spectrums.<br /><br />I read and highlighted the secondary research done in the studio, reviewed academic
          papers, watched ABA training videos, parent interview videos, and even documentaries on how people with autism
          live their daily lives and interact with their providers/caregivers. We looked at competitor apps (for ex.
          Birdbox), but there was nothing on the current market that alligned with our problem scope.<br /><br />We also
          read The New York Times Understanding Autism magazine religiously. This special issue covers topics ranging
          from child and family, autism and science, aiding the autistic, and autism in our culture. Articles and
          testimonials from various stakeholders helped us to understand and explore the problem scope.
          <br /><br />Together, these secondary research sources helped us build a solid foundation for our design and
          gave us the essential background knowledge that helped us make interview protocols for our primary research.

          the family to accept Lucas&#39;s diagnosis, the family have decided to get Lucas to do therapy as soon as
          possible so Lucas can gain more social skills. Lucas&#39;s doctor had suggested ABA therapy for the family to
          try out. Jessica took their son to a local ABA therapy center. After the waiting period, the BCBA Erin was
          able to assess Lucas on his behavior and performance.

          We chose orange because it represented encouragement, enthusiasm, and determination. Since purple is a bit of
          a cooler tone, we decided to make this our base color because it balanced out the bright orange and
          complimented the scheme well. We wanted to be wary of color contrast ratios because of WCAG accesibility
          standards and were mindful of this when choosing our surfaces, text, and line colors. As for our typography,
          we chose the sans serif font Gilroy since it was a modern font with a geometric touch. The geometric font
          paired nicely with our flat design, and had flexible font weights.

        <p class="text-209 poppins-normal-lynch-16px">
          Furthermore, I made a parent task flow to show how Jessica would use this app in her scenario and to display
          the detailed interactions that would help us ideate wireframes. After reviewing our user task flow for the
          document management system feature, we decided to eliminate it. We wanted to make sure we would design the
          feature when we had more research on privacy. Our initial idea was to use a google drive integration, but
          their system’s privacy is not ideal because once a file is deleted there are still traces of it in the system.
          (Google is currently working on fixing this!)
        </p>
        <p class="text-210 poppins-normal-lynch-16px">
          Before moving to the final design, we scheduled a meeting with our parent participants to review our
          wireframes. They gave us a lot of good feedback and raised some concerns about privacy regarding our fourth
          module of the concept map—the connect with others/sharing profile feature. We took her insights, and iterated
          on our wireframes. For the final design, we focused on designing the screens for the key tasks that we
          conjured up in our storyboards, and using Jessica’s scenario, we selected the several screens below to show
          the key features of each task.
        </p>
        <p class="text-211 poppins-normal-lynch-16px">
          This feature allows parents to create a routine for their child and act upon skill deficits/problematic
          behaviors by tracking behavior goals suggested by therapists at home. This tracked data overtime can create
          insights and explanations for certain behaviors. In Jessica’s case, she would use this to track whether or not
          Lucas has been succeeding in his morning routine by making sure he completes his nested mini tasks and
          checking if there are any improvements in behavior.

        <p class="text-213 poppins-normal-lynch-16px">
          The journal entry feature allows parents to record major incidents/outbursts, and their potential cause
          factors to construct a more complete health picture for their child using the ABC’s of ABA therapy. For
          example, this might help Jessica record any actions that help Lucas stop his outburts effectively. (Calling
          Lucas’ favorite teacher helps him calm down when he is self harming himself.)

          The data analytics section is where Jessica will be able to see auto populated insights based off of the data
          she collects from Lucas’ behavior. This is where she can learn from the patterns of repeated behavior and
          share a report of her findings to the BCBA if needed as well.

          Initially, the child’s profile was supposed to have the fourth module that allowed users to connect with other
          patients with similar profiles. However, we felt that we needed to work on a better flow for privacy and chose
          to hold off on this feature until we could better visualize a solution for this regarding HIPAA. The child’s
          profile enables the parent to add users to the caregiving team, and access the insight center shown above.

          The resource center is a education hub that gives parents and patients the ability to learn from curated
          resources based off tracked data. We wanted to make this as engaging as possible, so there are three different
          types of resources provided. First, there are articles and short posts that parents can read for quick
          information. Secondly, there are interactive videos that users can watch. Lastly, we created an interactive
          dialogue course for parents to feel engaged in the learning process.

          Our final feature was the medicine tracker. This allows Jessica to track and record all of Lucas’ medication
          side effects in one place. We also integrated a section that gave generic recommendations. This was to give
          low income parents information on alternative cost efficient medicines.

          All in all, in the future we plan to build out a communication feature that allows providers and caretakers to
          exchange health information regarding the child (with HIPAA compliance of course)! A future documentation
          management system would be something to consider as well. We might also explore an ASD child profile matching
          feature to create a networking aspect and build communities that will empower each other. Furthermore, we want
          to come up with guidelines to potentially use this model to adapt for other special needs. One constraint Gio
          has is that this app is still created with a specific scenario in mind (Jessica’s). I want to interview more
          parents to explore the unmet needs of children on the spectrum, and potentially co-design with them. The
          clinician’s app view needs to be ideated too. We plan to interview ASD children, since at some point, the data
          that is being collected will become theirs as they become adults. One team member is working on this for her
          thesis to continue the project. More to come!

          In the field of Autism research and study, parents’ data input is considered somewhat not reliable or
          trustworthy in the clinician’s perspective. Due to its inconsistency, there is a lack of training and enormous
          stress placed on the parents in the caregiving journey. However, parental involvement is extremely important
          for the progression of skills from ABA therapy sessions to more natural settings, and for the success of the
          child receiving ABA. Several studies have found that children are more successful when parents are
          consistently involved in the treatment (Ozonoff &amp; Cathcart, 1998).<br /><br />This collective effort
          requires the care team to assess the child, come up with a treatment plan, collect data, use data as guidance
          for therapy, and intervention to reassess. Therefore, we should design a consistent, efficient, and
          understandable way to help parents collect their ASD child’s data, so that they can contribute insights to
          their child’s treatment, understand their child better, and become a better advocate for their child’s autism.

          Goinvo’s previous work was extremely well researched and served as a great foundation for our app. However, it
          was last worked on in 2018, and so the designs were extremely outdated. Before I could pick up from where they
          had left off, I wanted to first understand Autism and the complexity of the disorder from different
          spectrums.<br /><br />I read and highlighted the secondary research done in the studio, reviewed academic
          papers, watched ABA training videos, parent interview videos, and even documentaries on how people with autism
          live their daily lives and interact with their providers/caregivers. We looked at competitor apps (for ex.
          Birdbox), but there was nothing on the current market that alligned with our problem scope.<br /><br />We also
          read The New York Times Understanding Autism magazine religiously. This special issue covers topics ranging
          from child and family, autism and science, aiding the autistic, and autism in our culture. Articles and
          testimonials from various stakeholders helped us to understand and explore the problem scope.
          <br /><br />Together, these secondary research sources helped us build a solid foundation for our design and
          gave us the essential background knowledge that helped us make interview protocols for our primary research.

          document management system feature, we decided to eliminate it. We wanted to make sure we would design the
          feature when we had more research on privacy. Our initial idea was to use a google drive integration, but
          their system’s privacy is not ideal because once a file is deleted there are still traces of it in the system.
          (Google is currently working on fixing this!)

        <p class="text-367 poppins-normal-lynch-16px">
          We chose orange because it represented encouragement, enthusiasm, and determination. Since purple is a bit of
          a cooler tone, we decided to make this our base color because it balanced out the bright orange and
          complimented the scheme well. We wanted to be wary of color contrast ratios because of WCAG accesibility
          standards and were mindful of this when choosing our surfaces, text, and line colors. As for our typography,
          we chose the sans serif font Gilroy since it was a modern font with a geometric touch. The geometric font
          paired nicely with our flat design, and had flexible font weights.

        <p class="text-368 poppins-normal-lynch-16px">
          Before moving to the final design, we scheduled a meeting with our parent participants to review our
          wireframes. They gave us a lot of good feedback and raised some concerns about privacy regarding our fourth
          module of the concept map—the connect with others/sharing profile feature. We took her insights, and iterated
          on our wireframes. For the final design, we focused on designing the screens for the key tasks that we
          conjured up in our storyboards, and using Jessica’s scenario, we selected the several screens below to show
          the key features of each task.
        </p>
        <p class="text-369 poppins-normal-lynch-16px">
          This feature allows parents to create a routine for their child and act upon skill deficits/problematic
          behaviors by tracking behavior goals suggested by therapists at home. This tracked data overtime can create
          insights and explanations for certain behaviors. In Jessica’s case, she would use this to track whether or not
          Lucas has been succeeding in his morning routine by making sure he completes his nested mini tasks and
          checking if there are any improvements in behavior.

          The journal entry feature allows parents to record major incidents/outbursts, and their potential cause
          factors to construct a more complete health picture for their child using the ABC’s of ABA therapy. For
          example, this might help Jessica record any actions that help Lucas stop his outburts effectively. (Calling
          Lucas’ favorite teacher helps him calm down when he is self harming himself.)

          The data analytics section is where Jessica will be able to see auto populated insights based off of the data
          she collects from Lucas’ behavior. This is where she can learn from the patterns of repeated behavior and
          share a report of her findings to the BCBA if needed as well.

          Initially, the child’s profile was supposed to have the fourth module that allowed users to connect with other
          patients with similar profiles. However, we felt that we needed to work on a better flow for privacy and chose
          to hold off on this feature until we could better visualize a solution for this regarding HIPAA. The child’s
          profile enables the parent to add users to the caregiving team, and access the insight center shown above.

          The resource center is a education hub that gives parents and patients the ability to learn from curated
          resources based off tracked data. We wanted to make this as engaging as possible, so there are three different
          types of resources provided. First, there are articles and short posts that parents can read for quick
          information. Secondly, there are interactive videos that users can watch. Lastly, we created an interactive
          dialogue course for parents to feel engaged in the learning process.

          low income parents information on alternative cost efficient medicines.

          All in all, in the future we plan to build out a communication feature that allows providers and caretakers to
          exchange health information regarding the child (with HIPAA compliance of course)! A future documentation
          management system would be something to consider as well. We might also explore an ASD child profile matching
          feature to create a networking aspect and build communities that will empower each other. Furthermore, we want
          to come up with guidelines to potentially use this model to adapt for other special needs. One constraint Gio
          has is that this app is still created with a specific scenario in mind (Jessica’s). I want to interview more
          parents to explore the unmet needs of children on the spectrum, and potentially co-design with them. The
          clinician’s app view needs to be ideated too. We plan to interview ASD children, since at some point, the data
          that is being collected will become theirs as they become adults. One team member is working on this for her
          thesis to continue the project. More to come!

          In the field of Autism research and study, parents’ data input is considered somewhat not reliable or
          trustworthy in the clinician’s perspective. Due to its inconsistency, there is a lack of training and enormous
          stress placed on the parents in the caregiving journey. However, parental involvement is extremely important
          for the progression of skills from ABA therapy sessions to more natural settings, and for the success of the
          child receiving ABA. Several studies have found that children are more successful when parents are
          consistently involved in the treatment (Ozonoff &amp; Cathcart, 1998).<br /><br />This collective effort
          requires the care team to assess the child, come up with a treatment plan, collect data, use data as guidance
          for therapy, and intervention to reassess. Therefore, we should design a consistent, efficient, and
          understandable way to help parents collect their ASD child’s data, so that they can contribute insights to
          their child’s treatment, understand their child better, and become a better advocate for their child’s autism.

          Goinvo’s previous work was extremely well researched and served as a great foundation for our app. However, it
          was last worked on in 2018, and so the designs were extremely outdated. Before I could pick up from where they
          had left off, I wanted to first understand Autism and the complexity of the disorder from different
          spectrums.<br /><br />I read and highlighted the secondary research done in the studio, reviewed academic
          papers, watched ABA training videos, parent interview videos, and even documentaries on how people with autism
          live their daily lives and interact with their providers/caregivers. We looked at competitor apps (for ex.
          Birdbox), but there was nothing on the current market that alligned with our problem scope.<br /><br />We also
          read The New York Times Understanding Autism magazine religiously. This special issue covers topics ranging
          from child and family, autism and science, aiding the autistic, and autism in our culture. Articles and
          testimonials from various stakeholders helped us to understand and explore the problem scope.
          <br /><br />Together, these secondary research sources helped us build a solid foundation for our design and
          gave us the essential background knowledge that helped us make interview protocols for our primary research.

              Jessica&#39;s 6 year old son Lucas was recently diagnosed with high functioning ASD. Although it was hard
              for the family to accept Lucas&#39;s diagnosis, the family have decided to get Lucas to do therapy as soon
              as possible so Lucas can gain more social skills. Lucas&#39;s doctor had suggested ABA therapy for the
              family to try out. Jessica took their son to a local ABA therapy center. After the waiting period, the
              BCBA Erin was able to assess Lucas on his behavior and performance.

          Furthermore, I made a parent task flow to show how Jessica would use this app in her scenario and to display
          the detailed interactions that would help us ideate wireframes. After reviewing our user task flow for the
          document management system feature, we decided to eliminate it. We wanted to make sure we would design the
          feature when we had more research on privacy. Our initial idea was to use a google drive integration, but
          their system’s privacy is not ideal because once a file is deleted there are still traces of it in the system.
          (Google is currently working on fixing this!)

        <p class="text-619 poppins-normal-lynch-16px">
          We chose orange because it represented encouragement, enthusiasm, and determination. Since purple is a bit of
          a cooler tone, we decided to make this our base color because it balanced out the bright orange and
          complimented the scheme well. We wanted to be wary of color contrast ratios because of WCAG accesibility
          standards and were mindful of this when choosing our surfaces, text, and line colors. As for our typography,
          we chose the sans serif font Gilroy since it was a modern font with a geometric touch. The geometric font
          paired nicely with our flat design, and had flexible font weights.

        <p class="text-620 poppins-normal-lynch-16px">
          Before moving to the final design, we scheduled a meeting with our parent participants to review our
          wireframes. They gave us a lot of good feedback and raised some concerns about privacy regarding our fourth
          module of the concept map—the connect with others/sharing profile feature. We took her insights, and iterated
          on our wireframes. For the final design, we focused on designing the screens for the key tasks that we
          conjured up in our storyboards, and using Jessica’s scenario, we selected the several screens below to show
          the key features of each task.
        </p>
        <p class="text-621 poppins-normal-lynch-16px">
          This feature allows parents to create a routine for their child and act upon skill deficits/problematic
          behaviors by tracking behavior goals suggested by therapists at home. This tracked data overtime can create
          insights and explanations for certain behaviors. In Jessica’s case, she would use this to track whether or not
          Lucas has been succeeding in his morning routine by making sure he completes his nested mini tasks and
          checking if there are any improvements in behavior.
        </p>
        <p class="text-622 poppins-normal-lynch-16px">
          The journal entry feature allows parents to record major incidents/outbursts, and their potential cause
          factors to construct a more complete health picture for their child using the ABC’s of ABA therapy. For
          example, this might help Jessica record any actions that help Lucas stop his outburts effectively. (Calling
          Lucas’ favorite teacher helps him calm down when he is self harming himself.)
        </p>
        <p class="text-623 poppins-normal-lynch-16px">
          The data analytics section is where Jessica will be able to see auto populated insights based off of the data
          she collects from Lucas’ behavior. This is where she can learn from the patterns of repeated behavior and
          share a report of her findings to the BCBA if needed as well.
        </p>
        <p class="text-624 poppins-normal-lynch-16px">
          Initially, the child’s profile was supposed to have the fourth module that allowed users to connect with other
          patients with similar profiles. However, we felt that we needed to work on a better flow for privacy and chose
          to hold off on this feature until we could better visualize a solution for this regarding HIPAA. The child’s
          profile enables the parent to add users to the caregiving team, and access the insight center shown above.
        </p>
        <p class="text-625 poppins-normal-lynch-16px">
          The resource center is a education hub that gives parents and patients the ability to learn from curated
          resources based off tracked data. We wanted to make this as engaging as possible, so there are three different
          types of resources provided. First, there are articles and short posts that parents can read for quick
          information. Secondly, there are interactive videos that users can watch. Lastly, we created an interactive
          dialogue course for parents to feel engaged in the learning process.

          Our final feature was the medicine tracker. This allows Jessica to track and record all of Lucas’ medication
          side effects in one place. We also integrated a section that gave generic recommendations. This was to give
          low income parents information on alternative cost efficient medicines.

          All in all, in the future we plan to build out a communication feature that allows providers and caretakers to
          exchange health information regarding the child (with HIPAA compliance of course)! A future documentation
          management system would be something to consider as well. We might also explore an ASD child profile matching
          feature to create a networking aspect and build communities that will empower each other. Furthermore, we want
          to come up with guidelines to potentially use this model to adapt for other special needs. One constraint Gio
          has is that this app is still created with a specific scenario in mind (Jessica’s). I want to interview more
          parents to explore the unmet needs of children on the spectrum, and potentially co-design with them. The
          clinician’s app view needs to be ideated too. We plan to interview ASD children since, at some point, the data
          that is being collected will become theirs as they become adults. One team member is working on this for her
          thesis to continue the project. More to come!
