          As I mentioned before, the tiger team’s main objective is to increase download and installation rates for
          cart. The problem at hand was that there was a significant amount of customers (18-20%) that purchased our
          product but don’t download/install it or don’t realize they can install it on other devices. We discussed the
          need for further UX research and created what we call a “Blue Sky Solution,” which is an overhaul of the
          current cart confirmation page that would guide users throughout each step of the download and installation
          process. This idea was proposed with our target demographic in mind (55+ aged individuals with novice levels
          of tech savviness).

          My team was very happy with the “Blue Sky Idea.” I had a wonderful time working with the team and I learned a
          lot about working with engineering constraints during my time here. If I had more time, I would have loved to
          have done more research on the different journeys to see if the positive results held for different devices
          (for example, mobile). All in all, I had a great internship and I am looking forward to seeing my designs get
          incorporated into the future version of cart.

          The previous steps on how to download the product were not intuitive enough for our users. There was no
          guidance on how to download the product on other devices as well, so most users just assumed they could only
          protect whatever device they purchased the product on.

        <p class="text-155 poppins-normal-lynch-16px">
          <span class="span poppins-normal-lynch-16px">These pain points are very important to address because </span
          ><span class="span poppins-semi-bold-lynch-16px"
            >if our products are not being fully utilized, the user doesn’t find as much value in their purchase and
            ultimately do not repurchase the product when their subscription ends.</span
          ><span class="span poppins-normal-lynch-16px"> With these takeaways in mind, I created user personas.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="text-156 poppins-normal-lynch-16px">
          With our personas in mind, I started ideating a couple of different ideas on how to approach these pain
          points. I explored different layout options, gamification of the download process, integration of AI chat
          boxes, and etc. By the end of my exploration phase I had designed over 20 different ideas.
        </p>
        <p class="text-157 poppins-normal-lynch-16px">
          I then proceeded to make user task flows for the post-purchase user journey. This was needed because the
          guided download instructions would change depending on what operating system or device the user was using, and
          so there were multiple journeys/edge cases that needed to be considered. After stakeholder meetings and
          discussing more about engineering constraints, we decided to move forward with the solution that incorporated
          the ideas that were received best by our users and were doable from a backend perspective.

          The new guided approach uses chevrons in the cards to allow the user to go back and forth between steps. The
          timeline lets the user to see where they are in the process. There is also an added loophole at the end of the
          journey for users to go through the same download process again for different devices.

          As I mentioned before, the tiger team’s main objective is to increase download and installation rates for
          cart. The problem at hand was that there was a significant amount of customers (18-20%) that purchased our
          product but don’t download/install it or don’t realize they can install it on other devices. We discussed the
          need for further UX research and created what we call a “Blue Sky Solution,” which is an overhaul of the
          current cart confirmation page that would guide users throughout each step of the download and installation
          process. This idea was proposed with our target demographic in mind (55+ aged individuals with novice levels
          of tech savviness).

          With our personas in mind, I started ideating a couple of different ideas on how to approach these pain
          points. I explored different layout options, gamification of the download process, integration of AI chat
          boxes, and etc. By the end of my exploration phase I had designed over 20 different ideas.

          I then proceeded to make user task flows for the post-purchase user journey. This was needed because the
          guided download instructions would change depending on what operating system or device the user was using, and
          so there were multiple journeys/edge cases that needed to be considered. After stakeholder meetings and
          discussing more about engineering constraints, we decided to move forward with the solution that incorporated
          the ideas that were received best by our users and were doable from a backend perspective.

          have done more research on the different journeys to see if the positive results held for different devices

          As I mentioned before, the tiger team’s main objective is to increase download and installation rates for
          cart. The problem at hand was that there was a significant amount of customers (18-20%) that purchased our
          product but don’t download/install it or don’t realize they can install it on other devices. We discussed the
          need for further UX research and created what we call a “Blue Sky Solution,” which is an overhaul of the
          current cart confirmation page that would guide users throughout each step of the download and installation
          process. This idea was proposed with our target demographic in mind (55+ aged individuals with novice levels
          of tech savviness).

          I then proceeded to make user task flows for the post-purchase user journey. This was needed because the
          guided download instructions would change depending on what operating system or device the user was using, and
          so there were multiple journeys/edge cases that needed to be considered. After stakeholder meetings and
          discussing more about engineering constraints, we decided to move forward with the solution that incorporated
          the ideas that were received best by our users and were doable from a backend perspective.

          As I mentioned before, the tiger team’s main objective is to increase download and installation rates for
          cart. The problem at hand was that there was a significant amount of customers (18-20%) that purchased our
          product but don’t download/install it or don’t realize they can install it on other devices. We discussed the
          need for further UX research and created what we call a “Blue Sky Solution,” which is an overhaul of the
          current cart confirmation page that would guide users throughout each step of the download and installation
          process. This idea was proposed with our target demographic in mind (55+ aged individuals with novice levels
          of tech savviness).

          Many users had issues with downloading the product. The most common issue is if they had incompatible third

          In the new design, there is an emphasis on the CTA with an animated double chevron to guide the user to their
          next steps as well.

          The new guided approach uses chevrons in the cards to allow the user to go back and forth between steps. The
          timeline lets the user to see where they are in the process. There is also an added loophole at the end of the
          journey for users to go through the same download process again for different devices.

          My team was very happy with the “Blue Sky Idea.” I had a wonderful time working with the team and I learned a
          lot about working with engineering constraints during my time here. If I had more time, I would have loved to
          have done more research on the different journeys to see if the positive results held for different devices
          (for example, mobile). All in all, I had a great internship and I am looking forward to seeing my designs get
          incorporated into the future version of cart.
