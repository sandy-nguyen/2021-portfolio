        <div class="feedback-widget-v3-1 poppins-bold-ebony-clay-20px">Feedback Widget v3</div>
        <p class="text-24 poppins-normal-lynch-16px">
          I spent the summer of 2021 as a Product Design Intern at MongoDB in Manhattan, New York. I was a part of the
          education team where I focused on creating reliable and effective experiences on our documentation, which
          serves as an instruction manual to all of our products. During my time here my primary project was to redesign
          the feedback widget by balancing delightful and functional UX with effective data collection to drive business
          decisions. This is important because the feedback widget serves as the heartbeat of our docs pages and the
          quality of feedback we receive directly impacts our docs content.
        </p>
        <p class="text-25 poppins-normal-lynch-16px-2">
          Before I jumped into the project, I did competitive analysis of 12 different companies and their feedback
          widgets. I also read some of the user feedback we had on the widget. A lot of pain points came from users
          having the impression that they would not be able to give specific feedback. This was because the initial
          screen of the widget was the star rating system, which asked the user to rate how helpful a page is from a
          scale of 1-5 but did not indicate to the user that there would be an opportunity for them to further expand on
          their thoughts.<br /><br />Next, I conducted user interviews with both our docs users and our internal docs
          team, who use the feedback widget responses to improve our page content. For the docs users, I wanted to
          evaluate how helpful certain features were to see what could be omitted or improved. As for the docs team, I
          wanted to figure out what features gave them the most helpful data. <br /><br />From my previously gathered
          feedback and user interviews, I was able to graph on an affinity map the importance of each feature from the
          perspectives of our users and docs writers.<br /><br />Let’s look at what I found:
        </p>
        <div class="conflicting-goals poppins-bold-ebony-clay-20px">Conflicting goals</div>
        <p class="text-26 poppins-normal-lynch-16px">
          After evaluating the affinity map, I realized that the two primary users of the feedback widget had
          conflicting goals. For example, our technical writers really like the star rating screen because it allows
          them to view how a page is doing on a quantitative scale, but our users don’t like it because it doesn’t add
          value to them in the submission journey. It was my goal to create a design that would solve the needs of both
          users.
        </p>
        <p class="text-27 poppins-normal-lynch-16px-2">
          With these takeaways in mind, I advocated for a solution that replaced the star rating system with a binary
          rating system, and to omit the checklist categories screen completely. This was because studies have shown
          that with likert systems, users tend to rate higher than they actually feel, causing inflation ratings. This
          is also due to the fact that when asked to rate from a scale of 1-5, users have a hard time differentiating
          what makes a product “good” versus “great”. A binary system has almost no overhead for users. <br /><br />As
          for omitting the checklist categories, not only did users tend to bounce on that screen, but the data
          collected from the input was insignificant to our docs team. I also recommended a redesign of the screenshot
          function, since users noted that it was a feature that was useful to them but because of the functionality of
          it (the current tool took a picture of the entire page), the feature added no value to our docs team. If users
          could pin point where a certain typo or bug is in a more specific manner by selecting certain elements on the
          page, this would benefit both users of the widget by reducing time spent submitting feedback since users would
          not have to elaborate on the section they are referring to in the text input and our team could easily take
          action with less effort. I created a pro/con list of each feature and presented them with designs to our
          stakeholders.

          Our main objective was to simplify the feedback input flow and to encourage users to provide context for their
          feedback. With many rounds of user testings and revisions, I was able to iterate to alleviate major pain
          points and here is what I had delivered and shipped!<br /><br />Here are a few final screens:

          education team where I focused on creating reliable and effective experiences on our documentation, which
          serves as an instruction manual to all of our products. During my time here my primary project was to redesign
          the feedback widget by balancing delightful and functional UX with effective data collection to drive business
          decisions. This is important because the feedback widget serves as the heartbeat of our docs pages and the
          quality of feedback we receive directly impacts our docs content.

        <p class="text-396 poppins-normal-lynch-16px-2">
          Before I jumped into the project, I did competitive analysis of 12 different companies and their feedback
          widgets. I also read some of the user feedback we had on the widget. A lot of pain points came from users
          having the impression that they would not be able to give specific feedback. This was because the initial
          screen of the widget was the star rating system, which asked the user to rate how helpful a page is from a
          scale of 1-5 but did not indicate to the user that there would be an opportunity for them to further expand on
          their thoughts.<br /><br />Next, I conducted user interviews with both our docs users and our internal docs
          team, who use the feedback widget responses to improve our page content. For the docs users, I wanted to
          evaluate how helpful certain features were to see what could be omitted or improved. As for the docs team, I
          wanted to figure out what features gave them the most helpful data. <br /><br />From my previously gathered
          feedback and user interviews, I was able to graph on an affinity map the importance of each feature from the
          perspectives of our users and docs writers.<br /><br />Let’s look at what I found:

        <p class="text-397 poppins-normal-lynch-16px">
          After evaluating the affinity map, I realized that the two primary users of the feedback widget had
          conflicting goals. For example, our technical writers really like the star rating screen because it allows
          them to view how a page is doing on a quantitative scale, but our users don’t like it because it doesn’t add
          value to them in the submission journey. It was my goal to create a design that would solve the needs of both
          users.

          With these takeaways in mind, I advocated for a solution that replaced the star rating system with a binary
          rating system, and to omit the checklist categories screen completely. This was because studies have shown
          that with likert systems, users tend to rate higher than they actually feel, causing inflation ratings. This
          is also due to the fact that when asked to rate from a scale of 1-5, users have a hard time differentiating
          what makes a product “good” versus “great”. A binary system has almost no overhead for users. <br /><br />As
          for omitting the checklist categories, not only did users tend to bounce on that screen, but the data
          collected from the input was insignificant to our docs team. I also recommended a redesign of the screenshot
          function, since users noted that it was a feature that was useful to them but because of the functionality of
          it (the current tool took a picture of the entire page), the feature added no value to our docs team. If users
          could pin point where a certain typo or bug is in a more specific manner by selecting certain elements on the
          page, this would benefit both users of the widget by reducing time spent submitting feedback since users would
          not have to elaborate on the section they are referring to in the text input and our team could easily take
          action with less effort. I created a pro/con list of each feature and presented them with designs to our
          stakeholders.

          After a couple rounds of design reviews and stakeholder meetings, I narrowed down on two designs and conducted
          user testing. I synthesized the research findings and moved forward with the design that had the best results

          writer at MongoDB then collaborated with me on the final copywriting and the rest is history!

        <p class="text-424 poppins-normal-lynch-16px">
          I spent the summer of 2021 as a Product Design Intern at MongoDB in Manhattan, New York. I was a part of the
          education team where I focused on creating reliable and effective experiences on our documentation, which
          serves as an instruction manual to all of our products. During my time here my primary project was to redesign
          the feedback widget by balancing delightful and functional UX with effective data collection to drive business
          decisions. This is important because the feedback widget serves as the heartbeat of our docs pages and the
          quality of feedback we receive directly impacts our docs content.

        <p class="text-435 poppins-normal-lynch-16px-2">
          Before I jumped into the project, I did competitive analysis of 12 different companies and their feedback
          widgets. I also read some of the user feedback we had on the widget. A lot of pain points came from users
          having the impression that they would not be able to give specific feedback. This was because the initial
          screen of the widget was the star rating system, which asked the user to rate how helpful a page is from a
          scale of 1-5 but did not indicate to the user that there would be an opportunity for them to further expand on
          their thoughts.<br /><br />Next, I conducted user interviews with both our docs users and our internal docs
          team, who use the feedback widget responses to improve our page content. For the docs users, I wanted to
          evaluate how helpful certain features were to see what could be omitted or improved. As for the docs team, I
          wanted to figure out what features gave them the most helpful data. <br /><br />From my previously gathered
          feedback and user interviews, I was able to graph on an affinity map the importance of each feature from the
          perspectives of our users and docs writers.<br /><br />Let’s look at what I found:

        <p class="text-436 poppins-normal-lynch-16px">
          After evaluating the affinity map, I realized that the two primary users of the feedback widget had
          conflicting goals. For example, our technical writers really like the star rating screen because it allows
          them to view how a page is doing on a quantitative scale, but our users don’t like it because it doesn’t add
          value to them in the submission journey. It was my goal to create a design that would solve the needs of both
          users.

          it (the current tool took a picture of the entire page), the feature added no value to our docs team. If users
          could pin point where a certain typo or bug is in a more specific manner by selecting certain elements on the
          page, this would benefit both users of the widget by reducing time spent submitting feedback since users would
          not have to elaborate on the section they are referring to in the text input and our team could easily take
          action with less effort. I created a pro/con list of each feature and presented them with designs to our

          I spent the summer of 2021 as a Product Design Intern at MongoDB in Manhattan, New York. I was a part of the
          education team where I focused on creating reliable and effective experiences on our documentation, which
          serves as an instruction manual to all of our products. During my time here my primary project was to redesign
          the feedback widget by balancing delightful and functional UX with effective data collection to drive business
          decisions. This is important because the feedback widget serves as the heartbeat of our docs pages and the
          quality of feedback we receive directly impacts our docs content.

          the education design team.

          Before I jumped into the project, I did competitive analysis of 12 different companies and their feedback
          widgets. I also read some of the user feedback we had on the widget. A lot of pain points came from users
          having the impression that they would not be able to give specific feedback. This was because the initial
          screen of the widget was the star rating system, which asked the user to rate how helpful a page is from a
          scale of 1-5 but did not indicate to the user that there would be an opportunity for them to further expand on
          their thoughts.<br /><br />Next, I conducted user interviews with both our docs users and our internal docs
          team, who use the feedback widget responses to improve our page content. For the docs users, I wanted to
          evaluate how helpful certain features were to see what could be omitted or improved. As for the docs team, I
          wanted to figure out what features gave them the most helpful data. <br /><br />From my previously gathered
          feedback and user interviews, I was able to graph on an affinity map the importance of each feature from the
          perspectives of our users and docs writers.<br /><br />Let’s look at what I found:

        <div class="surname-2 poppins-bold-ebony-clay-18px">Key takeaways:</div>
        <p class="text-469 poppins-normal-lynch-14px">
          After evaluating the affinity map, I realized that the two primary users of the feedback widget had
          conflicting goals. For example, our technical writers really like the star rating screen because it allows
          them to view how a page is doing on a quantitative scale, but our users don’t like it because it doesn’t add
          value to them in the submission journey. It was my goal to create a design that would solve the needs of both
          users.

            The star rating system added no value to our users, and checklist categories required too much overhead
            thought. Users just wanted to get to the textbox input.

          <p class="text-47-1 poppins-light-lynch-10px">
            The docs team rarely used the feedback widget since a lot of the feedback submitted had no context. The
            feedback widget did not encourage users to give actionable feedback.

            The current feedback widget journey was too long. All users interviewed expressed they would prefer a
            shorter feedback form.

        </div>
        <p class="text-473 poppins-normal-lynch-14px-2">
          With these takeaways in mind, I advocated for a solution that replaced the star rating system with a binary
          rating system, and to omit the checklist categories screen completely. This was because studies have shown
          that with likert systems, users tend to rate higher than they actually feel, causing inflation ratings. This
          is also due to the fact that when asked to rate from a scale of 1-5, users have a hard time differentiating
          what makes a product “good” versus “great”. A binary system has almost no overhead for users. <br /><br />As
          for omitting the checklist categories, not only did users tend to bounce on that screen, but the data
          collected from the input was insignificant to our docs team. I also recommended a redesign of the screenshot
          function, since users noted that it was a feature that was useful to them but because of the functionality of
          it (the current tool took a picture of the entire page), the feature added no value to our docs team. If users
          could pin point where a certain typo or bug is in a more specific manner by selecting certain elements on the
          page, this would benefit both users of the widget by reducing time spent submitting feedback since users would
